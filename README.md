## MTGMate.com Price scraping tool

This app was created after some discussion with friends while playing cards. I wanted to get a quick idea of the cost of a number of cards and the quantity available from my favourite australian website for purchasing the cards but the mobile website wasn't really suited to searching multiple cards in succession having to open a drawer to access the search option.
I decided to build a quick tool that I could use to pull the price information from the site. The whole tool was completed over a few hours, theres not much involved with it as it aside from using Cheerio to pull the relevant information out of the returned data.
